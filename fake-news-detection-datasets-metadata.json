This dataset was collected from realworld sources; the truthful articles were obtained by crawling articles from Reuters.com (News website). As for the fake news articles, they were collected from different sources. The fake news articles were collected from unreliable websites that were flagged by Politifact (a fact-checking organization in the USA) and Wikipedia. The dataset contains different types of articles on different topics, however, the majority of articles focus on political and World news topics.\n\nThe dataset consists of two CSV files. The first file named \u201CTrue.csv\u201D contains more than 12,600 articles from reuter.com. The second file named \u201CFake.csv\u201D contains more than 12,600 articles from different fake news outlet resources. Each article contains the following information: article title, text, type and the date the article was published on. To match the fake news data collected for kaggle.com, we focused mostly on collecting articles from 2016 to 2017. The data collected were cleaned and processed, however, the punctuations and mistakes that existed in the fake news were kept in the text.\n\nThe following table gives a breakdown of the categories and number of articles per category.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-user-content/o/inbox%2F6380913%2F3637b4f75c0c0169b36e2c62be008dcf%2FEkran%20Resmi%202022-12-07%2014.51.23.png?generation=1670413908576107\u0026alt=media)"}
